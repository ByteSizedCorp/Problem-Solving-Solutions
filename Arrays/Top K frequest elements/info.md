# Top K Frequent Elements

## Problem Statement

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `k`, return the `k` most frequent elements. You may return the answer in any order.

## Examples

### Example 1
```
Input: nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3], k = 2
Output: [1, 2]
```

### Example 2
```
Input: nums = [1], k = 1
Output: [1]
```

## Constraints

- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `k` is in the range `[1, the number of unique elements in the array]`
- It is guaranteed that the answer is unique.

## Follow-up

Could you solve it in `O(n)` time complexity and `O(n)` space complexity?
